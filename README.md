# Intruder_Detection_System
This project contains the code for my an Intruder Detection System that uses OpenCV and OpenFace for custom human face detection and sends alerts via mail.

Note:
The OpenFace model used here is nn4.small2.v1.t7 . In order to use the project you would need to download this model and paste it in the project root directory. This model is not added in this repository but I'll be adding it shortly.
